## Setting up the Platform


This platform is built on two packages. Each package is powered by the Drupal CMS, and connects with each other using the Drupal Services module. To learn more about Drupal, visit: https://www.drupal.org/


Each package contains two parts. (1) The code base and (2) the database dump. The database dump needs to be imported into a MySQL database and the code base settings configured.


* Importing the database from phpMyAdmin: https://www.drupal.org/node/81995
   
* Importing the database from command line: https://www.drupal.org/node/345225





## Admin credentials for the each package

 * Username: admin
 * Password: 123456

 _Note: "Change password before running the site in production mode."_
